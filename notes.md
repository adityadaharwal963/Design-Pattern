Why design pattern?
<b>"Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again
in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way
that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice".</b>

Essential Elements of a Pattern:
1. Pattern Name
2. Problem
3. Solution
4. Consequences
